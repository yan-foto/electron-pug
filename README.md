# electron pug
This module is a simple `file` protocol interceptor for [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) which compiles all (local) URLs to files with `.pug` extension (e.g `/home/electron-pug/index.pug`) on the fly.

npm install electron-pug
```

# Usage
Just initialize this module with desired options for [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) package and your locals:

```js
'use strict';

const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron');
const locals = {/* ...*/};
const pug = require('electron-pug')({pretty: true}, locals);

// Standard stuff

app.on('ready', () => {
  let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });

  mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.pug`);
  // the rest...
});
```

# Endorsements
Here is a list of all projects (known to me) who have silently endorsed this project (or its [predecessor](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-jade)) by copying the source code without attribution: `yet-another-electron-pug`, `electron-nunjucks`, `wfo-app`, `demetra-aplikacija`, `electron-twig`, `FreeFrontiers-App`, `electron-posthtml`, and many other that I failed to track down!
